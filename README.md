# 🏠 Home

**Your privacy-first, browser-based personal dashboard.**

"Home" is a minimalist productivity hub designed to keep your focus sharp and your data local. It combines note-taking, daily task tracking, and quick navigation in a clean, privacy-focused interface where everything lives in your browser's `localStorage`.

To get the full experience and stay in the flow, I recommend these Chrome extensions:
